# Flat Engine

### A flat graphics/game engine without unnecessary complications.

<br>

Graphics/game engine written in Rust using wgpu mainly for self-education purposes. The engine is designed to be integrated with the architecture of [BevyEngine] since I personally really like Bevy and wanted to use some crates from the Bevy ecosystem such as App, ECS and asset handling.

## Dependencies
- [wgpu] Wgpu graphics API
- [winit] Winit window management library
- [bevy_app] Application layer of Bevy
- [bevy_ecs] ECS (Entity-Component-System) implementation of Bevy
- [bevy_asset] Asset handling plugin of Bevy
